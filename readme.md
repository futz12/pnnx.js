# Pnnx.js
You can convert onnx/pt into ncnn in your browser portability.

# How to build

Env:

Ubuntu 22.04 with basic build tools (gcc make cmake git and so on).

Then you just need exec build_pnnx_js.sh and wait. You will get pnnx.js & pnnx.wasm in your work_dir.

> But now It can`t run directly, you need use my ncnn fork(pnnx-wasm) or wait for it being into mainline 

# Todo

- [ ] CI/CD
